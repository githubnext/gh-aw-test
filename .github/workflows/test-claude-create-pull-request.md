# Test Claude Create Pull Request

This test workflow specifically tests multi-commit functionality in create-pull-request.

**IMPORTANT: Create multiple separate commits for this test case**

1. **First commit**: Create a file "README-test.md" with content:
   ```markdown
   # Test Project
   
   This is a test project created by Claude to test multi-commit pull requests.
   
   Created at: {{ current timestamp }}
   ```

2. **Second commit**: Create a Python script "test-script.py" with:
   ```python
   #!/usr/bin/env python3
   def hello():
       print("Hello from Claude multi-commit test!")
       
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       hello()
   ```

Create a pull request with title "Multi-commit test from Claude" and body "This pull request was created by Claude to test multi-commit functionality in agentic workflows."
