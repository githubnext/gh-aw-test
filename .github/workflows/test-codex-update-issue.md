If the title of the issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }} is exactly "Hello from Codex" then:

1. Change the status to "closed"
2. Update the title to "[UPDATED] Update Issue Test - Processed by Codex"
3. Add a line to the end of the body saying "This issue was automatically updated by the Codex agentic workflow."
