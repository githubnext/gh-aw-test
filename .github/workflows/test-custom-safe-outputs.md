# Test Safe Outputs - Custom Engine

This workflow validates all safe output types using the custom engine implementation. It demonstrates the ability to use GitHub Actions steps directly in agentic workflows while leveraging the safe output processing system.

## Purpose

This is a comprehensive test workflow that exercises every available safe output type:

- **create-issue**: Creates test issues with custom engine
- **add-comment**: Posts comments on issues/PRs
- **create-pull-request**: Creates PRs with code changes
- **add-labels**: Adds labels to issues/PRs
- **update-issue**: Updates issue properties
- **push-to-pull-request-branch**: Pushes changes to branches
- **missing-tool**: Reports missing functionality (test simulation)
- **create-discussion**: Creates repository discussions
- **create-pull-request-review-comment**: Creates PR review comments
- **create-code-scanning-alert**: Generates SARIF repository security advisories

## Custom Engine Implementation

The workflow uses the custom engine with GitHub Actions steps to generate all the required safe output files. Each step creates the appropriate output file with test content that demonstrates the functionality.

## Test Content

All generated content is clearly marked as test data and includes:
- Timestamp information
- Trigger event details
- Workflow identification
- Clear indication that it's test data

The content can be safely created and cleaned up as part of testing the safe output functionality.
